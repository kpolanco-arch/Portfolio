                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <div>SolBank is a fictional challenger bank designed to disrupt traditional financial institutions with a seamless,
                    user-friendly digital experience. The brand’s core values— <strong>playful, clear, and trustworthy</strong> —guided the design
                    process,
                    ensuring that the interface is both engaging and reliable while maintaining a high level of usability.</div>

                <h3>Brand Identity</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>SolBank draws inspiration from my Peruvian heritage and the country’s currency, 'Soles,' which originates from
                    theSpanish word for 'sun' and is deeply rooted in Incan history.</p>
                    <p>The Inca civilization worshiped Inti, the sun god, as their most powerful deity, believing he brought life,
                    prosperity,and strength to their empire. Gold, often called the 'tears of the sun,' was sacred to the Incas, symbolizing
                    divine power and wealth.</p>    
                    <p>These historical influences shape SolBank’s identity—its golden-yellow hues not only reflect the brilliance of
                    the sun but also evoke the opulence of Incan gold artifacts, once used to adorn temples and honor their gods. Through
                    this connection, the brand embodies a legacy of strength, prosperity, and innovation, blending history with modern
                    financial empowerment.</p>
